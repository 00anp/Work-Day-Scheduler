# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project was built using bootstrap, jQuery and moment.js api's.

The goal is to let the user see a general work day schedule and input tasks that have time constraints.
Depending on the present hour the app will update to show which tasks had past, what's the present task and which are the future tasks.
